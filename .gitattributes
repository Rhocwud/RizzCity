- Tokens & secrets: the automation uses a repository secret named `GH_PAT` (Personal Access Token) with the minimum required scopes:
- `gist` (read & write) — required if creating gists
- `repo` (read & write) — required to commit `docs/ProjectInventory.csv`
- Optionally `workflow` if dispatching other workflows is needed
- DO NOT paste PATs in chat. Rotate the PAT periodically (current token expires 2026-09-06).
- Permissions: ensure repo Actions permissions allow workflows to push or create PRs. If PR creation fails, check repo Settings → Actions → Workflow permissions.
- Backup & auditing: `docs/ProjectInventory.csv` is the canonical inventory artifact. Keep it in `docs/` (versioned) and optionally upload per-run artifacts for long-term snapshots.

Recommended one-time dev tasks
1. Add `.gitattributes` with `*.luau text eol=lf` at repo root.  
2. Add `scripts/normalize_newlines.py` and run it before snapshotting any files that appear single-line.  
3. Add `scripts/create_gist_and_inventory.py` and `.github/workflows/publish-and-inventory.yml` (inventory + gist).  
4. Ensure `GH_PAT` secret exists with required scopes and test the workflow manually once.

Assistant behaviour (operational)
- At the start of chat: read this file and the CSV/filelinks, then fetch raw files using the recorded `raw` URLs. If access fails, request the developer to re-run the inventory workflow (no token requests).  
- For code edits: the assistant will produce patches, PR-ready diffs, or run-Action suggestions; it will not directly accept token values in chat.
