ðŸŸ¦ Modules & Services

OldCombatService.luau â†’ Early melee system, replaced during combat overhaul.
Rating: 1 (may salvage functions/logic when refining CombatService).

DashController.luau â†’ Separate dash/evade logic. Replaced by MovementControllerâ€™s integrated dash system.
Rating: 2 (pieces of evade/dash code may be useful).

RailGrindLegacy.luau â†’ Early grind script. Buggy, replaced with MovementController grind.
Rating: 2 (debug logic might be useful if grind breaks again).

ðŸŸ© Assets & Animation

SwordAnimations (Folder) â†’ Old R6-based sword swing animations. Now using R15.
Rating: 2 (may reference animation timing, but not reusable as-is).

Legacy Combat Animations (Folder) â†’ Placeholder punches/kicks, inconsistent rigging.
Rating: 2 (could borrow timing ideas, but most will be replaced).

ðŸŸ¨ Systems & Utilities

FeatureFlag_Old.luau â†’ Early version of feature flags before Shared/Config cleanup.
Rating: 1 (may reuse toggle patterns if new flag system breaks).

CameraController_Old.luau â†’ Pre-target-lock camera. Replaced by current CameraController.
Rating: 2 (some zoom/shift-lock handling could be recycled).

Adjacency (Old).luau â†’ Early territory zone adjacency system, later rewritten.
Rating: 1 (may be reused once we finalize territory control logic).

Notes

1 = Most likely to reuse (code patterns, logic, configs still relevant).

2 = Medium (may borrow ideas/snippets but outdated or partially replaced).

3 = Least likely (tied to abandoned systems like lanes/hazards/R6).

When pulling anything back, update its header version (e.g., v0.9.0 â†’ v1.0.1) and log it in CHANGELOG.txt.
