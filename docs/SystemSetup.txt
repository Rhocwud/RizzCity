Rizz City – System Setup Summary
Last Updated: 2025-09-06

Purpose
This file explains how project context is managed across chats and GitHub so ChatGPT always has access to current scripts, history, and archive.

Components
GitHub Repo (Live Source of Truth)
GitHub/RizzCity/docs/ ProjectFileLinks.txt and ProjectInventory.csv (Live Source of Truth)
Scripts are synced to Tyler's PC via Roblox Studio’s Sync to Disk feature.
The disk file location points to our GitHub repo Rizz City where it mirrors the Roblox Studio Explorer folder, preserving hierarchy and .luau files.
All .luau files on GitHub are able to be seen through GitHub API and GH_PAT token.

Project Folder (Chat Logs & Indexes)
All chat histories are saved here as .txt files with date + topic naming.
These preserve the reasoning, debugging, and planning behind each system.  
Do not treat the code within our chats as canonical source of truth.  Rather, this is a chat log to give you full access to all previous conversations and act like "Memomry", bypassing OpenAI's limitations put on ChgatGPT's project folders.
Also contains:
Contains Archived/unused scripts, indexed in Index.txt.
Scripts rated 1–3 for likelihood of reuse.

Workflow Summary
Roblox Studio Rizz City structure and LUA → all scripts using sync to disk feature → to Local Hard Drive on Tyler's PC which is a GitHub Repo
GitHub Desktop pushes canonical changes to GitHub = Live scripts (what the game is actually running). 
Project folder = Memory (chat logs, changelog, archive index).

When starting a new chat, ChatGPT should:
Load the SystemSetup.txt file (this file).
Reference GitHub for the current script state by using ProjectFileLinks.txt and add ProjectInventory.csv to view the current active code.
Use Project folder logs for reasoning/history when needed to get a full scope of what we have discussed.

Notes
Non-script assets (RemoteEvents, Workspace items) are not visible unless exported or described manually.
The GH_PAT token expires September 6, 2026 and is stored as a Secret inside the GitHub Repo
